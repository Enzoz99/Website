            8/20/23 - In the beginning, there was no website, then through hard work and dedication,
                     and the help of a mentor and other supportive groupmates, a website was conceived. 
                     Shortly after thy great creation had settled the architects participated in a 
                     team-building activity. The activity consisted of strategically getting a spherically 
                     shaped marble to be transported to a minuscule bucket via a system of rods.Thy group 
                     had to work together to reach the completion of the common goal at hand. Alas, neither 
                     team was able to bask in the light of victory and though they walked away smiling, it 
                     was all a facade for the shame inside.
