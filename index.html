            WEEK 1 8/20/23 - In the beginning, there was no website, then through hard work and dedication,
                     and the help of a mentor and other supportive groupmates, a website was conceived. 
                     Shortly after thy great creation had settled the architects participated in a 
                     team-building activity. The activity consisted of strategically getting a spherically 
                     shaped marble to be transported to a minuscule bucket via a system of rods.Thy group 
                     had to work together to reach the completion of the common goal at hand. Alas, neither 
                     team was able to bask in the light of victory and though they walked away smiling, it 
                     was all a facade for the shame inside.

            WEEK 3 8/21/23 - Production on a brand new project began. The rube goldberg machine would prove to be a 
            difficult feat to achieve with the given time constraints. However a team as smart as mine had never
            got the chance to prove their engineering prowess. Production continues as the first ramp begins to 
            take shape. The group unfortunately was split up and I, Enzo Zakari, was left with the energy 
            depleting task of tinkering a cad.

            WEEK 4 9/5/23 - With many hardships and delays the group was rushed and had to double production speed on their Rube
            Golderg Machine. Many moments passed as peers in their vicinity completed there challenge with relative
            ease. However the story would be different for group 2. The group was ambitious, determined, and most 
            importantly resilient. Then, a vision, not realized by any man woman or child before, had been fulfilled.
            A meticulassly hand crafted mater piece of a rube gold berg machine was constructed with features including 
            a stunning ramp with a 90 degree turn into an inginious pulley system that released a car with a needle not
            any thicker than a hair barreling towards a balloon down another ramp pitched at around 50 degrees. After
            19 heavily calculated tests the small car hit its mark and popped the balloon. The sound rippled through 
            the room like a wave of triumph soon after a glorious celebration followed as the grouped 2 basked in the 
            spotlight of success and victory.

            WEEK 5 9/18/23 - Not too long after the grand success of the rube goldberg machine the group was once again tasked with
            a challenge. This time an individual dilemma was to be tackled. A tough ask was given, a paper flotation device, 
            looming in the horizon like a storm destin to ravage a town. With a moments notice I got to work. I stared with 
            curiosity at the others as they were perfecting their intricate designs. I kept my design simple, only folding 
            up the sides and putting only one weight in the center. It was only after the contest where I realized more weight 
            could be added, and the flotation device champion could have been me. I lasted all five minutes during the 
            competition and though I did not win, I was still able to leave with pride for my design. Thursday of that week 
            after an informative presentation about computer engineering us pupils were assinged the unrelated challenge of 
            designing and measuring the letter E out of paper.

             WEEk 6 9/25/23 - As class began on september 18 and the students took their seats another grand week of education was
             upon them. This time the lesson called for a detailed description of computer engineering once again, and the many 
             intricate components of a computer. After a well thought out lesson, computers were given to each group with the task 
             of disassembling and reassembling all the components inside. We hastily got to work. Each time a piece was to be
             removed the precise location from its origin would be filmed for future reference. This strategy would work until it would 
             be revealed that tbe footage was not clear enough. Eventually through a grueling process of memorization and undescripitive 
             videos the internals of the pc came to fruition and the puzzle was solved.
